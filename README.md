# Animated Gate Card

A polished, responsive Home Assistant Lovelace card for gate and other cover entities. Its compact inline SVG depicts a double-leaf entrance gate, with separate opening and closing animations driven by the entity's live cover state.

The card never calls services on its own. Its Open, Close, and Stop buttons call Home Assistant's standard cover services only when clicked. The card fetches no external assets and contains no personal entity IDs.

## Features

- Compact, original SVG artwork of an entrance gate, pillars, fence, and driveway.
- Distinct animations for `opening` and `closing`; static open/closed appearance for those states.
- State pill, friendly name, and current position when the cover exposes `current_position`.
- Open, Close, and Stop controls using `cover.open_cover`, `cover.close_cover`, and `cover.stop_cover`; buttons are disabled when the action is unsupported or does not fit the current state.
- Delegated click handling and visible acknowledgement/error feedback for each cover command.
- Native entity selector in the card editor; each user chooses their own `cover` entity.
- Responsive layout with Home Assistant theme colors.
- Honors the operating system's reduced-motion preference.
- Unknown, unavailable, and nonstandard cover states degrade gracefully.

## Install with HACS

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS → ⋮ → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/Liionboy/lovelace-animated-gate-card` with category **Dashboard**.
3. Install **Animated Gate Card** and refresh the browser.
4. Add the card to your dashboard and select a `cover` entity in the visual editor.

This is a HACS Dashboard plugin, not a Home Assistant backend integration. The visual config editor uses the native `getConfigForm` API, available in Home Assistant 2026.6 and later.

## Configuration

The visual editor is recommended. Select any cover entity; no entity IDs are built into the card.

```yaml
type: custom:animated-gate-card
entity: cover.my_gate
title: Entrance gate
```

The card animates in response to the standard Home Assistant cover states: `opening`, `open`, `closing`, and `closed`. The current-position indicator is shown only when the entity supplies a numeric `current_position` attribute. Open/Close are enabled when useful for the current state; Stop appears enabled only while the gate is moving and when the entity reports that Stop is supported.

## Manual resource install

Copy `dist/animated-gate-card.js` to `/config/www/animated-gate-card.js`, add `/local/animated-gate-card.js` as a JavaScript module resource in **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**, refresh the browser, and use `type: custom:animated-gate-card`.
